# SpaceX-Launch-Tracker

## Note:
This Program was designed for the Waveshare 2.13 Inch E-Paper Display (Red/Black/White)!
You can buy it
[here](https://www.waveshare.com/2.13inch-e-paper-hat-b.htm).

## Description
This code uses the Pillow library to create the image which will be shown on the display.

The Display show all important informations about the next launch like these:

- Name of the next rocket (and the rocket after that)
- If it lands
- If it was reused
- how often it was reused
- when the rocket will launch
- The time the display refreshed itself
- The SpaceX logo works as a "Progress Bar" (Left side of X=Last launch, Right side= next launch, edge between red/black = current time)

I am still learning, if you see any errors or have a way to code it better, please contact me! :)
